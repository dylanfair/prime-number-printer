fn main() {
   // Order of program:
   // 1. Retrieve number from user
   // 2. Find all primes under that number
   // - If it is even, and not 2, then not a prime
   // - Maybe use the various prime checks (Mersenne and Fermat)
   // 3. If not, see if two primes add to it
   // - Find all primes less than number input and see if adding two of them equals that number
   //
   // A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not
   // a product of two smaller natural numbers.
